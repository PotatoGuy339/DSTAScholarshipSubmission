1. Blood Spatter Tracker
   The Blood Spatter Tracker is a WIP project I recently embarked on, combining my interest in forensics with my interest in engineering and computing. The idea is to create a program that is able to, from a picture taken of 1 or many blood spatters in a crime scene, reconstruct and visualise the likely points of origin of the blood, and visualise this in a 3D space using Artificial Reality(AR) technology. This serves as a substitute for/supplement to traditional blood stringing, which is time-inefficient, manpower resource-heavy, and subject to human error. The orientation of the blood spatters is detected by fiducial markers, commonly used in AR applications. Currently, I have developed the code for transforming a picture of a bloodstain taken at an angle to a 2D one, as well as the code to detect an assumed elliptical blood droplet, and calculate the predicted droplet trajectory. 
   
  Within this folder is:
  - Initial Plan Picture (Taken from a presentation I did)
  - Current Literature on the subject and existing products
  - 2D to 3D transformation code (based on AR methods)
  - Trajectory calculator
  
  I hope to work more on this and finish it in the future.
